getpkg
======

Alternative to ABS, uses svn to pull Arch Linux PKGBUILD and associated files.

Usage
======

Be sure to define a work directory which is where building will occur.  I recommend using an area mounted to tmpfs if you have enough RAM.  If none is defined, the current directory is used.
